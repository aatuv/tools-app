# tools-app

This is a web app that has some useful everyday tools for personal use.

## Content
Currently contains:

* A weather app for displaying the current weather and a forecast for the next five days (uses openweathermap.org)
* A clock app for displaying current time, both digital and traditional round clock format
* A timer app for setting a timer.
* A training schedule app, in which the user can add, edit and delete training excercises for each weekday

More content will be added in the future.

### Advice for enabling the weather app functionality

An api key for openweathermap.org is needed for the weather app to work. Navigate to https://openweathermap.org/ and sign up for free to paste in your personal api key.
